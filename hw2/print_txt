\nWelcome to Unix\n\n
Please clean up your directories.  The filesystem is getting full.\n
Our tcp/ip link to gamma is a little flaky, but seems to work.\n
The current version of ftp can only send files from your home\n
directory, and deletes them after they are sent!  Be careful.\n
\nNote: Restricted bourne shell in use.\n
\n\nUNIX System V, Release 2.2 (pokey)\n\n
